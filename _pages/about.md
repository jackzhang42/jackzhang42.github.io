Confusion.

I always get confused about things. There are various things which seem trivial to many people, but I alway get confused about them. 

The sun. The flower. The Universe. And, ourselves.

I want to know more.

For what?

I guess, if there is a God, we must solve the puzzles He prepared. This is the very reason of our existence.

But how? 

Solving puzzles can only rely on logic. Logic can only apply on what we observed in this world. This is how we get more close to God, and His puzzles.

As a PhD student in high energy physics experiment, I want to observe. Observe the nature, and share our observation with the world.
And, if possible, benefit the human being using the technology developed during work, and pass down the knowledge as much as we can.
